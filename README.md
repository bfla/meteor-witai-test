## Description
- The purpose of this Meteor app was to test a new package being developed.
- This package would create a Meteor integration for Wit.ai (an API for speech or natural language processing)
- The goal is to get a Wit.ai client working on browsers and iOS apps.

###Todos
- Create a meteor package for wit.ai
- Start with the javascript integration because that's the easiest
- Create an iOS (Cordova) integration
- Don't bother yet with an Android integration, since the app I'm building doesn't need that yet.
